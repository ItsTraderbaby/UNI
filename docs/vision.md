  <em>The World’s First Conversational Generative Emotion Interface (CGEI)</em>
</p>

---

Welcome to <strong>•UNI•</strong> (pronounced “you-n-eye”) — a messaging experience that turns every conversation into living art, powered by emotion, AI, and human connection.

> <strong>•UNI•</strong> is not just a chat app.
> It’s a new interface for feeling, remembering, and sharing — where the canvas of every message is finally alive.

## ✨ What If Chat Was Alive?

For 30 years, the world has texted in boxes.  
Static, gray, emotionless — a billion blank canvases scrolled every day.

But what if our conversations could *move* with us?  
What if messages pulsed with joy, flashed with anger, softened with tenderness?  
What if every chat was a living record of our shared feeling — as beautiful, unique, and dynamic as we are?

## 🌊 Why •UNI• Exists

•UNI• exists to awaken digital conversation.  
To close the gap between what we feel and what we send.

We’re not here to “disrupt” messaging.  
We’re here to **evolve** it.

- No more wasted white space
- No more “read receipts” as the only feedback
- No more one-size-fits-all bubbles

Every message, every moment, every relationship — deserves to be seen, heard, and felt.

## 🧬 CGEI: The New Interface Layer

**Conversational Generative Emotion Interface (CGEI)** is more than tech.  
It’s a philosophy:

- The UI should feel.
- The canvas should move.
- Emotion is the *atomic unit* of digital connection.

•UNI• is the first, but not the last.  
We claim this category not for ego — but for all who want deeper, truer, more creative human connection.

## 🏆 Our Manifesto

We believe:
- Art should live in every chat.
- AI should be a companion, not a replacement.
- Memories are sacred — let’s make them beautiful, together.
- The next revolution in technology is not just intelligence. It’s **emotion**.
